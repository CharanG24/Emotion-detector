# Emotion-detector

This project uses TensorFlow to identify human emotions from facial images. The model classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more, using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system is designed to classify facial expressions from a given image, providing insights into human emotional states.
